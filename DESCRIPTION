Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michael Nagle
Maintainer: Michael Nagle <michael.nagle@oregonstate.edu>
Description: 
    This package is an extension of SKAT, with the purpose of enabling and automating efficient parallelization of SKAT with resampling to calculate empirical p-values. This package provides high-level interfaces for efficient parallelization both across CPUs in a high-performance cluster (parallelized over scaffolds) as well as across cores (parallelized over SNP windows and/or null models).
