Title: Multi-Threaded Monte Carlo Sequence Kernel Association Test (MTMC-SKAT)
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Michael Nagle
Maintainer: Michael Nagle <michael.nagle@oregonstate.edu>
Description: This package is an extension of SKAT, with the purpose of enabling
    and automating efficient parallelization of SKAT with resampling to 
    calculate empirical p-values. This package provides high-level interfaces
    for efficient parallelization both across CPUs in a high-performance cluster
    (parallelized over scaffolds) as well as across cores(parallelized over SNP
    windows and/or null models).
